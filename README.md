# OutMigration
Data cleaning and exploratory analysis project to study out-migration within the United States.

This project evaluates out-migration and independent variables which contribute to this phenomenon in the United States.  The project begins by merging several data sets which each contribute to a better understanding of the problem.  Next, data cleaning is performed prior to the exploratory analysis.  Last, exploratory analysis is conducted using correlations, scatterplots, and boxplots; if additional questions arose during the exploratory analysis, they were pursued.

The goals of this project were to:
1) Combine multiple data sets.
2) Clean data.
