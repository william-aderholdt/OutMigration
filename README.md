# Out Migration
Data cleaning and exploratory analysis project to study out-migration within the United States.

This project evaluates out-migration and independent variables which contribute to this phenomenon in the United States. Out-migration occurs when people leave an area (i.e. County) to move to another area; this had more recently contributed to the collapse of many small rural towns. Understanding what factors impact out-migration can assist elected leaders to develop interventions which might offset this phenomenon.

The project begins by merging several data sets which each contribute to a better understanding of the problem.  Next, data cleaning is performed prior to the exploratory analysis.  Last, exploratory analysis is conducted using correlations, scatterplots, and boxplots; if additional questions arose during the exploratory analysis, they were pursued.

To view this project, you can click on the ipynb file in the main folder.  If you would like to make changes to the project or use the output data you will need: python 3.7, jupyter notebook, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy.

The goals of this project were to:
1) Combine multiple data sets.
2) Clean data.
3) Perform exploratory analysis of the data.

Thank you all for checking out my project.  Please let me know if you have any feedback.
